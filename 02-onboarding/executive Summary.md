Executive Summary 
SafeGuardHER is a revolutionary cross-platform mobile application designed to revolutionize women's safety during public transportation and ride-sharing journeys. This innovative app leverages cutting-edge automated audio analysis, voice activation, and a range of unique features to provide women with an accessible and comprehensive safety solution. SafeGuardHER's project vision is to empower women by addressing the pressing problem of safety during travel, offering a unique business opportunity while adhering to a set of well-defined objectives. 
It has come to our attention that existing safety applications in Pakistan, such as the Punjab Police app, require manual activation when users encounter threatening situations. Unfortunately, these manual activation requirements often clash with the real-life urgency of such situations, where individuals may not have the presence of mind to activate the app and seek help. This is where SafeGuardHER steps in as a solution. Our app offers automated threat alerts and emergency features by actively analyzing the user's environment, feeding audio data into sophisticated hate speech and scream detection models. To ensure a rapid and accurate response, these models employ ensemble modeling bagging techniques. The output from these models is subjected to an evaluation metric, which determines if a threat is predicted. If a threat is detected, the app displays a 7-second countdown timer, allowing the user to deactivate it. However, in the absence of a response, the app triggers emergency actions. It alerts the user's pre-saved emergency contacts with a danger message, the user's current location, and initiates a call to the police station. 
In addition to this, our app features a voice-activated alert system. Users can trigger an alert simply by uttering the predefined keyword, "Safeguard help me." The app performs voice recognition to confirm the user's identity and initiate emergency actions if the user's voice is recognized. 
Another valuable feature is the fake call simulator. Users can activate this function, which simulates a call from an official-looking police officer, creating the illusion of a genuine conversation. This feature is designed to deter potential threats and provide users with an effective means of self-defense in emergency situations. SafeGuardHER aims to be a reliable and intuitive safety companion that offers women the protection they deserve during their journeys.



The project is divided into 4 major components:
    1. Data Gathering and Model Testing
    2. Developing Ensemble Model Architecture 
    3. App Development and Model Integration 
    4. App Testing and Refining Process 
In the first iteration of our project, our primary objective is to develop robust hate speech and scream detection models. We will train these models using a diverse dataset, with the aim of achieving an accuracy rate of 85% or higher. Key to this process is the careful labeling of the dataset, categorizing audio inputs as threats or non-threats, which will be instrumental in refining and optimizing the models. 
Additionally, we plan to create prototypes of our app using Figma and commence its development utilizing Flutter. Another crucial task for this phase is the development of a voice recognition model. This model will be trained using a limited set of audio inputs provided by the user, enabling the voice-activated feature within the app. This initial iteration sets the foundation for the development of SafeGuardHER, focusing on the core components that will enhance women's safety and security during their journeys.
